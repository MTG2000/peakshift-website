      <div class="projectDetails column">
        <p>The Lemariku founders came to us with an idea to create an online marketplace that allows people in Indonesia to sell second hand fashion items.</p>

        <p>In a saturated market, it was our first challenge to clearly communicated the OVP and differentiate Lemariku from the competition. We had to create a platform that is catered to the specific behaviours of the Indonesian target audience, such as allowing for cash payments and utilising local delivery services like GO-Jek.</p>

        <p>Additional to that was to design and develop an interface that is intuitive to use for them, as they find websites too complicated, and don't trust online payments.</p>

        <h4>Strategy &amp; Roadmap</h4>
        <p>Our collaboration with Lemariku started from the inception of the idea, and when they had only a hypothesis and rough set of requirements.</p>

        <p>Together, we refined the definition of what the product was, and set the objectives to work towards. Since we use the Agile project management methodology we created a backlog and broke down the roadmap into a serise of sprints.</p>

        <h4>Branding</h4>
        <p>The brand was specifically catered to the Indonesian market. The brand name Lemariku means &#8220;my closet&#8221;, which comes from &#8220;lemari&#8221; meaning <em>closet</em> and &#8220;ku&#8221; meaning <em>my</em> in Indonesian. 

        <p>The logo was created to clearly visualise that it is a fashion application and add to the meaning of the name.</p>

        </figure>

        <h4>User Interface &amp; Expereince</h4>

        <p>Sellers mainly used Instagram to reach potential buyers to advertise their fashion items so we wanted to create an experience that was familliar, with while providing tools to address the challenges they had with current soltuions</p>

        <p>In order to encourage sellers to share their profiles, we wanted to provide some personalistion options so we allowed them to choose a colour from a pallete that would distinguish their profiles and items in search results.</p>
