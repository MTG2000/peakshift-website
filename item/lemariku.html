			<p>What do they do: Lemariku is an online platform that makes shopping of second-hand fashion easy and comfortable for Indonesians.</p>

			<p>People can list items they want to sell on the platform, which is an online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, allowing them to chat to each other and slect the ideal payment and delivery method for both parties.</p>

			<p>The platform is specifically created and catered to the purchase behaviour to the indonesian consumer allowing for cash payments and utilising local delivery services like GO-Jek.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p> Lemariku aims to make online shopping more accessible to Indonesians who:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>find websites too complicated;</li>
          <li>find shipping costs too high;</li>
          <li>donâ€™t trust online payments;</li>
          <li>want to talk to the seller before making a purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In a saturated market, it was our first challenge to clearly communicated the OVP and differentiate it from the competition. The real challenge came in designing and developing a website that is intuitive to use for the Indonesian target audience, who find websites too complicated, while building all of the functionality Lemariku wanted to offer.</p>
