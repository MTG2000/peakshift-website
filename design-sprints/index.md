The typical Kick-off Meeting and Requirements Gathering process will be enhanced with a Peak Shift flavor of Google Ventures’ Design Sprint. This is a process we’ve used for numerous clients and always gets us to reach alignment and set expecatations early on in the development process.

This 5-day process uses design thinking to produce a realistic prototype that allows us to gain insight as an outside contractor, define behavioural requirements, and perform User Testing on a early visual prototype in order to gather real user feedback.

The first two days require a couple hours of your involvement — it is mandatory to the process and we’ve seen this upfront time investment gets everyone in alignment early with the project goals and avoids issues during the implementation phase.

To preserve time when coming to a decision we will utilise voting on suggestions offered by individuals, over lengthy discussions so you will have to select a single person on your team as “The Decider”. This person is able to veto certain decisions made by the group.
